A view acts as a filter on the underlying tables referenced in the view. The query that defines the view can be 
from one or more tables or from other views in the current or other databases. Distributed queries can also be used to 
define views that use data from multiple heterogeneous sources. This is useful, for example, if you want to combine 
similarly structured data from different servers, each of which stores data for a different region of your organization.

Views are generally used to focus, simplify, and customize the perception each user has of the database. 
Views can be used as security mechanisms by letting users access data through the view, without granting the users 
permissions to directly access the underlying base tables of the view. Views can be used to provide a backward compatible 
interface to emulate a table that used to exist but whose schema has changed. 
Views can also be used when you copy data to and from SQL Server to improve performance and to partition data.

You can create views in SQL Server 2017 by using SQL Server Management Studio or Transact-SQL. 
A view can be used for the following purposes:

    1. To focus, simplify, and customize the perception each user has of the database.
    2. As a security mechanism by allowing users to access data through the view, without granting the users permissions 
      to directly access the underlying base tables.
    3. To provide a backward compatible interface to emulate a table whose schema has changed.
